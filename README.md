# PERSONAL WEBSITE - PORTFOLIO


# Description
Welcome to my project! This is the first project I created after almost a month of studying as a Front End Web Developer.
It was created with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap because they are the first technologies I learned.
In fact, in the project directory you will find: the two HTML files (index.html and contacts.html) and the directory called "assets" where you find the images and the css file.
The objective with this site was certainly to put into practice the initial knowledge acquired but also to create a well-organized website so as to make navigation fluid and practical.
I hope you like it and look forward to your contribution.
In the future, once I learn new technologies, I will definitely update the site by inserting new features and adding all the projects I create.
